A fan entity is a device that controls the different vectors of your fan such as speed, direction and oscillation. Derive entity platforms from 'homeassistant.components.fan.FanEntity'.

#Properties
TIP
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement update() or async_update() to fetch data.

Name	Type	Default	Description
current_direction	str | None	None	The current direction of the fan.
is_on	bool | None	None	True if the fan is on.
oscillating	bool | None	None	True if the fan is oscillating.
percentage	int | None	0	The current speed percentage. Must be a value between 0 (off) and 100.
preset_mode	str | None	None	The current preset_mode. One of the values in preset_modes or None if no preset is active.
preset_modes	list[str] | None	None	The list of supported preset_modes. This is an arbitrary list of str and should not contain any speeds.
speed_count	int	100	The number of speeds the fan supports.

#Preset Modes
A fan may have preset modes that automatically control the percentage speed or other functionality. Common examples include auto, smart, whoosh, eco, and breeze. If no preset mode is set, the preset_mode property must be set to None.

Preset modes should not include named (manual) speed settings as these should be represented as percentages.

Manually setting a speed must disable any set preset mode. If it is possible to set a percentage speed manually without disabling the preset mode, create a switch or service to represent the mode.

#Supported Features
Supported features are defined by using values in the FanEntityFeature enum and are combined using the bitwise or (|) operator.

Value	Description
DIRECTION	The fan supports changing the direction.
OSCILLATE	The fan supports oscillation.
PRESET_MODE	The fan supports preset modes.
SET_SPEED	The fan supports setting the speed percentage and optional preset modes.
