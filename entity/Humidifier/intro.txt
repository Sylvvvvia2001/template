A humidifier entity is a device whose main purpose is to control humidity, i.e. a humidifier or dehumidifier. Derive entity platforms from homeassistant.components.humidifier.HumidifierEntity

#Properties
TIP
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement update() or async_update() to fetch data.

#Modes
A device can have different modes of operation that it might want to show to the user. They could be viewed as presets or some device states with reduced or enhanced functionality for special conditions, i.e. "auto" or "baby". There are a couple of built-in modes that will offer translations, but you're also allowed to add custom modes if that better represents the device.

MODE_NORMAL	No preset is active, normal operation
MODE_ECO	Device is running an energy-saving mode
MODE_AWAY	Device is in away mode
MODE_BOOST	Device turn all valve full up
MODE_COMFORT	Device is in comfort mode
MODE_HOME	Device is in home mode
MODE_SLEEP	Device is prepared for sleep
MODE_AUTO	Device is controlling humidity by itself
MODE_BABY	Device is trying to optimize for babies

#Supported Features
Supported features are defined by using values in the HumidifierEntityFeature enum and are combined using the bitwise or (|) operator.

Value	Description
MODES	The device supports different modes.

#Action
The action property may return the current operating state of the device, whether it is humidifying or idle. This is an informational property. Please note that when the device is off, the action attribute, if present, will automatically be replaced with "off". Also, please note that setting action to off does not replace the is_on property.
