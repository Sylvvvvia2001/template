A device tracker is a read-only entity that provides presence information. There are two types of device tracker entities, a ScannerEntity and a TrackerEntity.

#ScannerEntity
A ScannerEntity reports the connected state of a device on the local network. If the device is connected the ScannerEntity will have state home and if the device is not connected the state will be not_home.

Derive a platform entity from homeassistant.components.device_tracker.config_entry.ScannerEntity

#Properties
TIP
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement update() or async_update() to fetch data.

CAUTION
ScannerEntity does not support attribute shorthand for property implementation

Name	Type	Default	Description
battery_level	int | None	None	The battery level of the device.
hostname	str | None	None	The hostname of the device.
ip_address	str | None	None	The IP address of the device.
is_connected	bool	Required	The connection state of the device.
mac_address	str | None	None	The MAC address of the device.
source_type	SourceType	Required	The source type, eg gps or router, of the device.

#DHCP discovery
If the device tracker source_type is router and the ip_address, mac_address, and hostname properties have been set, the data will speed up DHCP discovery as the system will not have to wait for DHCP discover packets to find existing devices.

#TrackerEntity
A TrackerEntity tracks the location of a device and reports it either as a location name, a zone name or home or not_home states. A TrackerEntity normally receives GPS coordinates to determine its state. Either location_name or latitude and longitude should be set to report state.
