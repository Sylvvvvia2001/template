A valve entity controls valve devices such as the water or gas valves in your home. Derive a platform entity from homeassistant.components.valve.ValveEntity.

#Properties
TIP
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement update() or async_update() to fetch data.

Name	Type	Default	Description
current_valve_position	int | None	None	The current position of the valve where 0 means closed and 100 is fully open. This attribute is required on valves with reports_position = True, where it's used to determine state.
is_closed	bool | None	None	If the valve is closed or not. Used to determine state for valves that don't report position.
is_closing	bool | None	None	If the valve is closing or not. Used to determine state.
is_opening	bool | None	None	If the valve is opening or not. Used to determine state.
reports_position	bool	Required	If the valve knows its position or not.
