An image entity can display a static image. Derive a platform entity from homeassistant.components.image.ImageEntity.

The image entity is a simplified version of the camera entity, and supports serving a static image or an image URL that can be fetched.

An implementation can provide either a URL from where an image will automatically be fetched or image data as bytes. When providing a URL, the fetched image will be cached in self._cached_image, set self._cached_image to None to invalidate the cache.

#Properties
TIP
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement update() or async_update() to fetch data.

Name	Type	Default	Description
content_type	str	image/jpeg	The content-type of the image, set automatically if the image entity provides a URL.
image_last_updated	datetime.datetime | None	None	Timestamp of when the image was last updated. Used to determine state. Frontend will call image or async_image after this changes.
image_url	str | None	UNDEFINED	Optional URL from where the image should be fetched.
