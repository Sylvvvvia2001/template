A climate entity controls temperature, humidity, or fans, such as A/C systems and humidifiers. Derive a platform entity from homeassistant.components.climate.ClimateEntity

#Properties
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement update() or async_update() to fetch data.

#HAVC modes
You are only allowed to use the built-in HVAC modes, provided by the HVACMode enum. If you want another mode, add a preset instead.

Name	Description
HVACMode.OFF	The device is turned off.
HVACMode.HEAT	The device is set to heat to a target temperature.
HVACMode.COOL	The device is set to cool to a target temperature.
HVACMode.HEAT_COOL	The device is set to heat/cool to a target temperature range.
HVACMode.AUTO	The device is set to a schedule, learned behavior, AI.
HVACMode.DRY	The device is set to dry/humidity mode.
HVACMode.FAN_ONLY	The device only has the fan on. No heating or cooling taking place.

#HVAC Action
The HVAC action describes the current action. This is different from the mode, because if a device is set to heat, and the target temperature is already achieved, the device will not be actively heating anymore. It is only allowed to use the built-in HVAC actions, provided by the HVACAction enum.

Name	Description
HVACAction.OFF	Device is turned off.
HVACAction.PREHEATING	Device is preheating.
HVACAction.HEATING	Device is heating.
HVACAction.COOLING	Device is cooling.
HVACAction.DRYING	Device is drying.
HVACAction.FAN	Device has fan on.
HVACAction.IDLE	Device is idle.

#Presets
A device can have different presets that it might want to show to the user. Common presets are "Away" or "Eco". There are a couple of built-in presets that will offer translations, but you're also allowed to add custom presets.

Name	Description
NONE	No preset is active
ECO	Device is running an energy-saving mode
AWAY	Device is in away mode
BOOST	Device turn all valve full up
COMFORT	Device is in comfort mode
HOME	Device is in home mode
SLEEP	Device is prepared for sleep
ACTIVITY	Device is reacting to activity (e.g. movement sensors)

#Fan modes
A device's fan can have different states. There are a couple of built-in fan modes, but you're also allowed to use custom fan modes.

Name
FAN_ON
FAN_OFF
FAN_AUTO
FAN_LOW
FAN_MEDIUM
FAN_HIGH
FAN_MIDDLE
FAN_FOCUS
FAN_DIFFUSE

#Swing modes
The device fan can have different swing modes that it wants the user to know about/control.

Name	Description
SWING_OFF	The fan is not swinging.
SWING_ON	The fan is swinging.
SWING_VERTICAL	The fan is swinging vertical.
SWING_HORIZONTAL	The fan is swinging horizontal.
SWING_BOTH	The fan is swinging both horizontal and vertical.

#Supported Features
Supported features are defined by using values in the ClimateEntityFeature enum and are combined using the bitwise or (|) operator.

Value	Description
TARGET_TEMPERATURE	The device supports a target temperature.
TARGET_TEMPERATURE_RANGE	The device supports a ranged target temperature. Used for HVAC modes heat_cool and auto
TARGET_HUMIDITY	The device supports a target humidity.
FAN_MODE	The device supports fan modes.
PRESET_MODE	The device supports presets.
SWING_MODE	The device supports swing modes.
AUX_HEAT	The device supports auxiliary heaters.
TURN_ON	The device supports turn on.
TURN_OFF	The device supports turn off.
