A switch entity turns on or off something, for example a relay. Derive a platform entity from homeassistant.components.switch.SwitchEntity. To represent something which can be turned on or off but can't be controlled, for example a wall switch which transmits its state but can't be turned on or off from Home Assistant, a Binary Sensor is a better choice. To represent something which doesn't have a state, for example a door bell push button, a custom event or a Device Trigger is a better choice.
