A select is an entity that allows the user to select an option from a list of limited options provided by the integration. Derive entity platforms from homeassistant.components.select.SelectEntity

This entity should only be used in cases there is no better fitting option available. For example, a bulb can have user selectable light effects. While that could be done using this select entity, it should really be part of the light entity, which already supports light effects.

#Properties
TIP
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement update() or async_update() to fetch data.

Name	Type	Default	Description
current_option	str	None	The current select option
options	list	Required	A list of available options as strings
Other properties that are common to all entities such as icon, unit_of_measurement, name etc are also applicable.
