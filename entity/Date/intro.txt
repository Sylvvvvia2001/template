A date is an entity that allows the user to input a date to an integration. Derive entity platforms from homeassistant.components.date.DateEntity

#Properties
TIP
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement update() or async_update() to fetch data.

Name	Type	Default	Description
native_value	datetime.date | None	Required	The value of the date.

Other properties that are common to all entities such as icon, name etc are also applicable.
